## POS

The Onexpand POS is a modern web-based Point of Sale system developed with Vue.js (Vue 2) on the frontend and PHP/Laravel on the backend. It’s built with modularity, scalability, and performance in mind — designed to run smoothly on tablets, desktop browsers, and embedded kiosk devices.

The Onexpand POS is designed to empower small and medium-sized retailers, distributors, and service-based businesses by providing a seamless bridge between front-line sales operations and back-office systems.

- Real-time Integration:
    - Automatically syncs invoices, payments, and stock movements with ERP systems, reducing manual entry and human errors.
- Fast Checkout Experience:
    - Optimized UI/UX allows cashiers to complete transactions quickly with minimal training — ideal for high-volume retail environments.
- Multi-location Management:
    - Supports multiple branches, warehouses, and terminals — each with independent or shared product catalogs and price lists.
- Comprehensive Reporting:
    - Provides sales summaries, cashier activity, and item performance analytics to guide business decisions.

- Flexible Deployment:
    - Can be deployed on-premise or in the cloud, accessible via tablets, PCs, or all-in-one POS terminals.

## Documents

The Onexpand Documents module is a robust, modular web application designed to manage complex document workflows — from creation and approval to automated email distribution and ERP synchronization. It’s built with a Vue.js frontend and a Laravel (PHP) backend, emphasizing scalability, modularity, and maintainability.

The Onexpand Documents system simplifies and automates document-based workflows — transforming manual approval chains and scattered records into a centralized, rule-driven process.

    - Multi-level approval hierarchies ensure that purchase orders, invoices, and requests move seamlessly through the right approvers, reducing delays and miscommunication.

- Audit-Ready Compliance:
    - Every action — creation, approval, cancellation, or rejection — is logged and traceable, ensuring accountability and regulatory compliance.

- Seamless ERP Integration:
    - Once approved, documents are automatically pushed to SAP Business One or other ERP systems, eliminating redundant data entry and synchronization errors.

- Real-Time Collaboration:
    - Teams can work simultaneously across multiple departments while maintaining visibility on document progress and approval status.

- Customizable Policies:
    - Businesses can define flexible approval policies per document type, department, or user group — adapting easily to changing internal procedures.

- Reduced Administrative Overhead:
    - Automated notifications, standardized templates, and centralized access drastically reduce manual effort and the risk of errors.

- Scalable for Enterprises:
    - Built for growing organizations with complex workflows, supporting multi-branch and multi-user environments.

## Access Control

The Onexpand Access Control system is a centralized security and permission management module designed to unify authentication and authorization across all Onexpand services. It’s developed with Jquery frontend for an intuitive interface and a Laravel (PHP) backend for reliable and extensible logic.

The Onexpand Access Control platform ensures that your organization’s systems remain secure, compliant, and easy to manage. It gives administrators full visibility and control over who can access what, while ensuring end-users experience a seamless login and workflow process.

- Real-Time Employee Tracking:
    - Managers and safety officers could instantly view who’s currently on-site, across multiple buildings or departments.

- Emergency Preparedness:
    - The system could execute rollback calls (mass check-ins and confirmations) during evacuations or lockdowns, ensuring every employee is accounted for.

- Automated Timesheets:
    - Integrated attendance data eliminated manual time-tracking and improved payroll accuracy.

- Data-Driven Insights:
    - Historical data allowed HR and Operations teams to analyze entry patterns, detect anomalies, and optimize shift scheduling.

- Seamless Integration:
    - Designed to connect easily with other Onexpand modules like Documents (for leave management) and POS (for access-linked expense records).
